        <h1>The Crossing of Time<br>and Paths</h1>
    </section>
    <section class="circular-ruins">
        <a href="Circular-Ruins/">No one saw him disembark in the unanimous night, no one saw the bamboo canoe sink into
            the sacred mud, but in
            a few days there was no one who did not know that the taciturn man came from the South and that his home had
            been one of those numberless villages upstream in the deeply cleft side of the mountain, where the Zend
            language has not been contaminated by Greek and where leprosy is infrequent. What is certain is that the
            grey man kissed the mud, climbed up the bank with pushing aside (probably, without feeling) the blades which
            were lacerating his flesh, and crawled, nauseated and bloodstained, up to the circular enclosure crowned
            with a stone tiger or horse, which sometimes was the color of flame and now was that of ashes.</a>
        <a href="Circular-Ruins/">This circle was a temple which had been devoured by ancient fires, profaned by the
            miasmal jungle, and whose
            god no longer received the homage of men. The stranger stretched himself out beneath the pedestal. He was
            awakened by the sun high overhead. He was not astonished to find that his wounds had healed; he closed his
            pallid eyes and slept, not through weakness of flesh but through determination of will. He knew that this
            temple was the place required for his invincible intent; he knew that the incessant trees had not succeeded
            in strangling the ruins of another propitious temple downstream which had once belonged to gods now burned
            and dead; he knew that his immediate obligation was to dream.</a>
        <a href="Circular-Ruins/">Toward midnight he was awakened by the inconsolable shriek of a bird. Tracks of bare
            feet, some figs and a
            jug warned him that the men of the region had been spying respectfully on his sleep, soliciting his
            protection or afraid of his magic. He felt a chill of fear, and sought out a sepulchral niche in the
            dilapidated wall where he concealed himself among unfamiliar leaves.</a>
        <a href="Circular-Ruins/">The purpose which guided him was not impossible, though supernatural. He wanted to
            dream a man; he wanted to
            dream him in minute entirety and impose him on reality. This magic project had exhausted the entire expanse
            of his mind; if someone had asked him his name or to relate some event of his former life, he would not have
            been able to give an answer. This uninhabited, ruined temple suited him, for it is contained a minimum of
            visible world; the proximity of the workmen also suited him, for they took it upon themselves to provide for
            his frugal needs. The rice and fruit they brought him were nourishment enough for his body, which was
            consecrated to the sole task of sleeping and dreaming.</a>
        <a href="Circular-Ruins/">At first, his dreams were chaotic; then in a short while they became dialectic in
            nature. The stranger
            dreamed that he was in the center of a circular amphitheater which was more or less the burnt temple; clouds
            of taciturn students filled the tiers of seats; the faces of the farthest ones hung at a distance of many
            centuries and as high as the stars, but their features were completely precise.</a>
        <a href="Circular-Ruins/">The man lectured his pupils on anatomy, cosmography, and magic: the faces listened
            anxiously and tried to
            answer understandingly, as if they guessed the importance of that examination which would redeem one of them
            from his condition of empty illusion and interpolate him into the real world. Asleep or awake, the man
            thought over the answers of his phantoms, did not allow himself to be deceived by imposters, and in certain
            perplexities he sensed a growing intelligence. He was seeking a soul worthy of participating in the
            universe.</a>
        <a href="Circular-Ruins/">After nine or ten nights he understood with a certain bitterness that he could expect
            nothing from those
            pupils who accepted his doctrine passively, but that he could expect something from those who occasionally
            dared to oppose him. The former group, although worthy of love and affection, could not ascend to the level
            of individuals; the latter pre-existed to a slightly greater degree. One afternoon (now afternoons were also
            given over to sleep, now he was only awake for a couple hours at daybreak) he dismissed the vast illusory
            student body for good and kept only one pupil. He was a taciturn, sallow boy, at times intractable, and
            whose sharp features resembled of those of his dreamer. The brusque elimination of his fellow students did
            not disconcert him for long; after a few private lessons, his progress was enough to astound the
            teacher.</a>
        <a href="Circular-Ruins/">Nevertheless, a catastrophe took place. One day, the man emerged from his sleep as if
            from a viscous desert,
            looked at the useless afternoon light which he immediately confused with the dawn, and understood that he
            had not dreamed. All that night and all day long, the intolerable lucidity of insomnia fell upon him. He
            tried exploring the forest, to lose his strength; among the hemlock he barely succeeded in experiencing
            several short snatchs of sleep, veined with fleeting, rudimentary visions that were useless. He tried to
            assemble the student body but scarcely had he articulated a few brief words of exhortation when it became
            deformed and was then erased. In his almost perpetual vigil, tears of anger burned his old eyes.</a>
        <a href="Circular-Ruins/">He understood that modeling the incoherent and vertiginous matter of which dreams are
            composed was the most
            difficult task that a man could undertake, even though he should penetrate all the enigmas of a superior and
            inferior order; much more difficult than weaving a rope out of sand or coining the faceless wind. He swore
            he would forget the enormous hallucination which had thrown him off at first, and he sought another method
            of work.</a>
        <a href="Circular-Ruins/">Before putting it into execution, he spent a month recovering his strength, which had
            been squandered by his
            delirium. He abandoned all premeditation of dreaming and almost immediately succeeded in sleeping a
            reasonable part of each day. The few times that he had dreams during this period, he paid no attention to
            them. Before resuming his task, he waited until the moon's disk was perfect. Then, in the afternoon, he
            purified himself in the waters of the river, worshiped the planetary gods, pronounced the prescribed
            syllables of a mighty name, and went to sleep. He dreamed almost immediately, with his heart throbbing.</a>
        <a href="Circular-Ruins/">He dreamed that it was warm, secret, about the size of a clenched fist, and of a
            garnet color within the
            penumbra of a human body as yet without face or sex; during fourteen lucid nights he dreampt of it with
            meticulous love. Every night he perceived it more clearly. He did not touch it; he only permitted himself to
            witness it, to observe it, and occasionally to rectify it with a glance. He perceived it and lived it from
            all angles and distances. On the fourteenth night he lightly touched the pulmonary artery with his index
            finger, then the whole heart, outside and inside. He was satisfied with the examination.</a>
        <a href="Circular-Ruins/">He deliberately did not dream for a night; he took up the heart again, invoked the
            name of a planet, and
            undertook the vision of another of the principle organs. Within a year he had come to the skeleton and the
            eyelids. The innumerable hair was perhaps the most difficult task. He dreamed an entire man--a young man,
            but who did not sit up or talk, who was unable to open his eyes. Night after night, the man dreamt him
            asleep.</a>
        <a href="Circular-Ruins/">In the Gnostic cosmosgonies, demiurges fashion a red Adam who cannot stand; as a
            clumsy, crude and elemental
            as this Adam of dust was the Adam of dreams forged by the wizard's nights. One afternoon, the man almost
            destroyed his entire work, but then changed his mind. (It would have been better had he destroyed it.) When
            he had exhausted all supplications to the deities of earth, he threw himself at the feet of the effigy which
            was perhaps a tiger or perhaps a colt and implored its unknown help. That evening, at twilight, he dreamt of
            the statue. He dreamt it was alive, tremulous: it was not an atrocious bastard of a tiger and a colt, but at
            the same time these two fiery creatures and also a bull, a rose, and a storm.</a>
        <a href="Circular-Ruins/">This multiple god revealed to him that his earthly name was Fire, and that in this
            circular temple (and in
            others like it) people had once made sacrifices to him and worshiped him, and that he would magically
            animate the dreamed phantom, in such a way that all creatures, except Fire itself and the dreamer, would
            believe to be a man of flesh and blood. He commanded that once this man had been instructed in all the
            rites, he should be sent to the other ruined temple whose pyramids were still standing downstream, so that
            some voice would glorify him in that deserted edifice. In the dream of the man that dreamed, the dreamed one
            awoke.</a>
        <a href="Circular-Ruins/">The wizard carried out the orders he had been given. He devoted a certain length of
            time (which finally
            proved to be two years) to instructing him in the mysteries of the universe and the cult of fire. Secretly,
            he was pained at the idea of being separated from him. On the pretext of pedagogical necessity, each day he
            increased the number of hours dedicated to dreaming. He also remade the right shoulder, which was somewhat
            defective. At times, he was disturbed by the impression that all this had already happened . . . In general,
            his days were happy; when he closed his eyes, he thought: Now I will be with my son. Or, more rarely: The
            son I have engendered is waiting for me and will not exist if I do not go to him.</a>
        <a href="Circular-Ruins/">Gradually, he began accustoming him to reality. Once he ordered him to place a flag on
            a faraway peak. The
            next day the flag was fluttering on the peak. He tried other analogous experiments, each time more
            audacious. With a certain bitterness, he understood that his son was ready to be born--and perhaps
            impatient. That night he kissed him for the first time and sent him off to the other temple whose remains
            were turning white downstream, across many miles of inextricable jungle and marshes. Before doing this (and
            so that his son should never know that he was a phantom, so that he should think himself a man like any
            other) he destroyed in him all memory of his years of apprenticeship.</a>
        <a href="Circular-Ruins/">His victory and peace became blurred with boredom. In the twilight times of dusk and
            dawn, he would prostrate
            himself before the stone figure, perhaps imagining his unreal son carrying out identical rites in other
            circular ruins downstream; at night he no longer dreamed, or dreamed as any man does. His perceptions of the
            sounds and forms of the universe became somewhat pallid: his absent son was being nourished by these
            diminution of his soul.</a>
        <a href="Circular-Ruins/">The purpose of his life had been fulfilled; the man remained in a kind of ecstasy.
            After a certain time,
            which some chronicles prefer to compute in years and others in decades, two oarsmen awoke him at midnight;
            he could not see their faces, but they spoke to him of a charmed man in a temple of the North, capable of
            walking on fire without burning himself. The wizard suddenly remembered the words of the god. He remembered
            that of all the creatures that people the earth, Fire was the only one who knew his son to be a phantom.
            This memory, which at first calmed him, ended by tormenting him. He feared lest his son should meditate on
            this abnormal privilege and by some means find out he was a mere simulacrum. Not to be a man, to be a
            projection of another man's dreams--what an incomparable humiliation, what madness!</a>
        <a href="Circular-Ruins/">Any father is interested in the sons he has procreated (or permitted) out of the mere
            confusion of happiness;
            it was natural that the wizard should fear for the future of that son whom he had thought out entrail by
            entrail, feature by feature, in a thousand and one secret nights.</a>
        <a href="Circular-Ruins/">His misgivings ended abruptly, but not without certain forewarnings. First (after a
            long drought) a remote
            cloud, as light as a bird, appeared on a hill; then, toward the South, the sky took on the rose color of
            leopard's gums; then came clouds of smoke which rusted the metal of the nights; afterwards came the
            panic-stricken flight of wild animals. For what had happened many centuries before was repeating itself.
        </a>
        <a href="Circular-Ruins/">The ruins of the sanctuary of the god of Fire was destroyed by fire. In a dawn without
            birds, the wizard saw
            the concentric fire licking the walls. For a moment, he thought of taking refuge in the water, but then he
            understood that death was coming to crown his old age and absolve him from his labors. He walked toward the
            sheets of flame. They did not bite his flesh, they caressed him and flooded him without heat or combustion.
            With relief, with humiliation, with terror, he understood that he also was an illusion, that someone else
            was dreaming him.</a>

    <section class="book-of-sand">
        <a href="book-of-sand/">The line is made up of an infinite number of points; the plane of an infinite number of
            lines; the volume of an infinite number of planes; the hypervolume of an infinite number of volumes. No,
            unquestionably this is not — more geometrico — the best way of beginning my story. To claim that is it true
            is nowadays the convention of every made-up story. Mine, however, is true.</a>
        <a href="book-of-sand/">I live alone in a fourth-floor apartment on Belgrano Street, in Buenos Aires. Late one
            evening, a few months back, I heard a knock at my door. I opened it and a stranger stood there. He was a
            tall man, with nondescript features — or perhaps it was my myopia that made them seem that way. Dressed in
            gray and carrying a gray suitcase in his hand, he had an unassuming look about him. I saw at once that he
            was a foreigner. At first, he struck me as old; only later did I realize that I had been misled by his thin
            blond hair, which was, in a Scandinavian sort of way, almost white. During the course of our conversation,
            which was not to last an hour, I found out that he came from the Orkneys.</a>
        <a href="book-of-sand/">I invited him in, pointing to a chair. He paused awhile before speaking. A kind of
            gloom emanated from him — as it does now from me. "I sell Bibles," he said. Somewhat pedantically, I
            replied, "In this house are several English Bibles, including the first - John Wicliffe's. I also have
            Cipriano de Valera's, Luther's — which, from a literary viewpoint, is the worst — and a Latin copy of the
            Vulgate. As you see, it's not exactly Bibles I stand in need of."</a>
        <a href="book-of-sand/">After a few moments of silence, he said, "I don't only sell Bibles. I can show you a
            holy book I came across on the outskirts of Bikaner. It may interest you." He opened the suitcase and laid
            the book on a table. It was an octavo volume, bound in cloth. There was no doubt that it had passed through
            many hands. Examining it, I was surprised by its unusual weight. On the spine were the words "Holy Writ"
            and, below them, "Bombay."</a>
        <a href="book-of-sand/">"Nineteenth century, probably," I remarked. "I don't know," he said. "I've never found
            out." I opened the book at random. The script was strange to me. The pages, which were worn and
            typographically poor, were laid out in a double column, as in a Bible. The text was closely printed, and it
            was ordered in versicles. In the upper corners of the pages were Arabic numbers. I noticed that one
            left-hand page bore the number (let us say) 40,514 and the facing right-hand page 999. I turned the leaf; it
            was numbered with eight digits. It also bore a small illustration, like the kind used in dictionaries — an
            anchor drawn with pen and ink, as if by a schoolboy's clumsy hand.</a>
        <a href="book-of-sand/">It was at this point that the stranger said, "Look at the illustration closely. You'll
            never see it again." I noted my place and closed the book. At once, I reopened it. Page by page, in vain, I
            looked for the illustration of the anchor. "It seems to be a version of Scriptures in some Indian language,
            is it not?" I said to hide my dismay.</a>
        <a href="book-of-sands/">"No," he replied. Then, as if confiding a secret, he lowered his voice. "I acquired the
            book in a town out on the plain in exchange for a handful of rupees and a Bible. Its owner did not know how
            to read. I suspect that he saw the Book of Books as a talisman. He was of the lowest caste; nobody but other
            untouchables could tread his shadow without contamination. He told me his book was called the Book of Sand,
            because neither the book nor the sand has any beginning or end." </a>
        <a href="book-of-sand/">The stranger asked me to find the first page. I laid my left hand on the cover and,
            trying to put my thumb on the flyleaf, I opened the book. It was useless. Every time I tried, a number of
            pages came between the cover and my thumb. It was as if they kept growing from the book.</a>
        <a href="book-of-sand/">"Now find the last page." Again I failed. In a voice that was not mine, I barely
            managed to stammer, "This can't be."Still speaking in a low voice, the stranger said, "It can't be, but it
            is. The number of pages in this book is no more or less than infinite. None is the first page, none the
            last. I don't know why they're numbered in this arbitrary way. Perhaps to suggest that the terms of an
            infinite series admit any number." </a>
        <a href="book-of-sand/">Then, as if he were thinking aloud, he said, "If space is infinite, we may be at any
            point in space. If time is infinite, we may be at any point in time." His speculations irritated me. "You
            are religious, no doubt?" I asked him."Yes, I'm a Presbyterian. My conscience is clear. I am reasonably sure
            of not having cheated the native when I gave him the Word of God in exchange for his devilish book."</a>
        <a href="book-of-sand/">I assured him that he had nothing to reproach himself for, and I asked if he were just
            passing through this part of the world. He replied that he planned to return to his country in a few days.
            It was then that I learned that he was a Scot from the Orkney Islands. I told him I had a great personal
            affection for Scotland, through my love of Stevenson and Hume."You mean Stevenson and Robbie Burns," he
            corrected.</a>
        <a href="book-of-sand/">While we spoke, I kept exploring the infinite book. With feigned indifference, I asked,
            "Do you intend to offer this curiosity to the British Museum?" "No. I'm offering it to you," he said, and he
            stipulated a rather high sum for the book. I answered, in all truthfulness, that such a sum was out of my
            reach, and I began thinking. After a minute or two, I came up with a scheme.</a>
        <a href="book-of-sand/">"I propose a swap, " I said. "You got this book for a handful of rupees and a copy of
            the Bible. I'll offer you the amount of my pension check, which I've just collected, and my black-letter
            Wicliffe Bible. I inherited it from my ancestors." "A black-letter Wicliffe!" he murmured.</a>
        <a href="book-of-sand/">I went to my bedroom and brought him the money and the book. He turned the leaves and
            studied the title page with all the fervor of a true bibliophile. "It's a deal," he said. It amazed me that
            he did not haggle. Only later was I to realize that he had entered my house with his mind made up to sell
            the book. Without counting the money, he put it away.</a>
        <a href="book-of-sand/">We talked about India, about Orkney, and about the Norwegian jarls who once ruled it.
            It was night when the man left. I have not seen him again, nor do I know his name.</a>
        <a href="book-of-sand/">I thought of keeping the Book of Sand in the space left on the shelf by the Wiclif, but
            in the end I decided to hide it behind the volumes of a broken set of The Thousand and One Nights. I went to
            bed and did not sleep. At three or four in the morning, I turned on the light. I got down the impossible
            book and leafed through its pages. On one of them I saw engraved a mask. The upper corner of the page
            carried a number, which I no longer recall, elevated to the ninth power.</a>
        <a href="book-of-sand/">I showed no one my treasure. To the luck of owning it was added the fear of having it
            stolen, and then the misgiving that it might not truly be infinite. These twin preoccupations intensified my
            old misanthropy. I had only a few friends left; I now stopped seeing even them. A prisoner of the book, I
            almost never went out anymore. After studying its frayed spine and covers with a magnifying glass, I
            rejected the possibility of a contrivance of any sort. The small illustrations, I verified, came two
            thousand pages apart. I set about listing them alphabetically in a notebook, which I was not long in filling
            up. Never once was an illustration repeated. At night, in the meager intervals my insomnia granted, I
            dreamed of the book.</a>
        <a href="book-of-sand/">Summer came and went, and I realized that the book was monstrous. What good did it do
            me to think that I, who looked upon the volume with my eyes, who held it in my hands, was any less
            monstrous? I felt that the book was a nightmarish object, an obscene thing that affronted and tainted
            reality itself.</a>
        <a href="book-of-sand/">I thought of fire, but I feared that the burning of an infinite book might likewise
            prove infinite and suffocate the planet with smoke. Somewhere I recalled reading that the best place to hide
            a leaf is in a forest. Before retirement, I worked on Mexico Street, at the Argentine National Library,
            which contains nine hundred thousand volumes. I knew that to the right of the entrance a curved staircase
            leads down into the basement, where books and maps and periodicals are kept. One day I went there and,
            slipping past a member of the staff and trying not to notice at what height or distance from the door, I
            lost the Book of Sand on one of the basement's musty shelves.</a>
    </section>

        <a href="forking-paths/">. . . and I hung up the phone. Immediately I recollected the voice that had spoken in
            German. It was that of Captain Richard Madden. Madden, in Viktor Runeberg's office, meant the end of all our
            work and - though this seemed a secondary matter, or should have seemed so to me - of our lives also. His
            being there meant that Runeberg had been arrested or murdered. 1 Before the sun set on this same day, I ran
            the same risk. Madden was implacable. Rather, to be more accurate, he was obliged to be implacable. An
            Irishman in the service of England, a man suspected of equivocal feelings if not of actual treachery, how
            could he fail to welcome and seize upon this extraordinary piece of luck: the discovery, capture and perhaps
            the deaths of two agents of Imperial Germany?</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">I went up to my bedroom. Absurd though the gesture was, I closed and locked the door. I
            threw myself down on my narrow iron bed, and waited on my back. The never changing rooftops filled the
            window, and the hazy six o'clock sun hung in the sky. It seemed incredible that this day, a day without
            warnings or omens, might be that of my implacable death. In despite of my dead father, in despite of having
            been a child in one of the symmetrical gardens of Hai Feng, was I to die now?</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">Then I reflected that all things happen, happen to one, precisely now. Century follows
            century, and things happen only in the present. There are countless men in the air, on land and at sea, and
            all that really happens happens to me . . . The almost unbearable memory of Madden's long horseface put an
            end to these wandering thoughts.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">In the midst of my hatred and terror (now that it no longer matters to me to speak of
            terror, now that I have outwitted Richard Madden, now that my neck hankers for the hangman's noose), I knew
            that the fast-moving and doubtless happy soldier did not suspect that I possessed the Secret - the name of
            the exact site of the new British artillery park on the Ancre. A bird streaked across the misty sky and,
            absently, I turned it into an airplane and then that airplane into many in the skies of France, shattering
            the artillery park under a rain of bombs.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">If only my mouth, before it should be silenced by a bullet, could shout this name in
            such a way that it could be heard in Germany ... My voice, my human voice, was weak. How could it reach the
            ear of the Chief? The ear of that sick and hateful man who knew nothing of Runeberg or of me except that we
            were in Staffordshire. A man who, sitting in his arid Berlin office, leafed infinitely through newspapers,
            looking in vain for news from us. I said aloud, "I must flee."</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">I sat up on the bed, in senseless and perfect silence, as if Madden was already peering
            at me. Something - perhaps merely a desire to prove my total penury to myself - made me empty out my
            pockets. I found just what I knew I was going to find. The American watch, the nickel-plated chain and the
            square coin, the key ring with the useless but compromising keys to Runeberg's office, the notebook, a
            letter which I decided to destroy at once (and which I did not destroy), a five shilling piece, two single
            shillings and some pennies, a red and blue pencil, a handkerchief - and a revolver with a single bullet.
            Absurdly I held it and weighed it in my hand, to give myself courage. Vaguely I thought that a pistol shot
            can be heard for a great distance.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">In ten minutes I had developed my plan. The telephone directory gave me the name of the
            one person capable of passing on the information. He lived in a suburb of Fenton, less than half an hour
            away by train. I am a timorous man. I can say it now, now that I have brought my incredibly risky plan to an
            end. It was not easy to bring about, and I know that its execution was terrible. I did not do it for Germany
            - no! Such a barbarous country is of no importance to me, particularly since it had degraded me by making me
            become a spy. Furthermore, I knew an Englishman - a modest man - who, for me, is as great as Goethe. I did
            not speak with him for more than an hour, but during that time, he was Goethe.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">I carried out my plan because I felt the Chief had some fear of those of my race, of
            those uncountable forebears whose culmination lies in me. I wished to prove to him that a yellow man could
            save his armies. Besides, I had to escape the Captain. His hands and voice could, at any moment, knock and
            beckon at my door.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">Silently, I dressed, took leave of myself in the mirror, went down the stairs, sneaked
            a look at the quiet street, and went out. The station was not far from my house, but I thought it more
            prudent to take a cab. I told myself that I thus ran less chance of being recognized. The truth is that, in
            the deserted street, I felt infinitely visible and vulnerable. I recall that I told the driver to stop short
            of the main entrance. I got out with a painful and deliberate slowness.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">I was going to the village of Ashgrove, but took a ticket for a station further on. The
            train would leave in a few minutes, at eight-fifty. I hurried, for the next would not go until half past
            nine. There was almost no one on the platform. I walked through the carriages. I remember some farmers, a
            woman dressed in mourning, a youth deep in Tacitus' Annals and a wounded, happy soldier.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">At last the train pulled out. A man I recognized ran furiously, but vainly, the length
            of the platform. It was Captain Richard Madden. Shattered, trembling, I huddled in the distant corner of the
            seat, as far as possible from the fearful window.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">From utter terror I passed into a state of almost abject happiness. I told myself that
            the duel had already started and that I had won the first encounter by besting my adversary in his first
            attack - even if it was only for forty minutes - by an accident of fate. I argued that so small a victory
            prefigured a total victory. I argued that it was not so trivial, that were it not for the precious accident
            of the train schedule, I would be in prison or dead. I argued, with no less sophism, that my timorous
            happiness was proof that I was man enough to bring this adventure to a successful conclusion. From my
            weakness I drew strength that never left me.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">I foresee that man will resign himself each day to new abominations, that soon only
            soldiers and bandits will be left. To them I offer this advice: Whosoever would undertake some atrocious
            enterprise should act as if it were already accomplished, should impose upon himself a future as irrevocable
            as the past. Thus I proceeded, while with the eyes of a man already dead, I contemplated the fluctuations of
            the day which would probably be my last, and watched the diffuse coming of night.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">The train crept along gently, amid ash trees. It slowed down and stopped, almost in the
            middle of a field. No one called the name of a station. "Ashgrove?" I asked some children on the platform.
            "Ashgrove," they replied. I got out.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">A lamp lit the platform, but the children's faces remained in a shadow. One of them
            asked me: "Are you going to Dr. Stephen Albert's house?" Without waiting for my answer, another said: "The
            house is a good distance away but you won't get lost if you take the road to the left and bear to the left
            at every crossroad." I threw them a coin (my last), went down some stone steps and started along a deserted
            road. At a slight incline, the road ran downhill. It was a plain dirt way, and overhead the branches of
            trees intermingled, while a round moon hung low in the sky as if to keep me company.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">For a moment I thought that Richard Madden might in some way have divined my desperate
            intent. At once I realized that this would be impossible. The advice about turning always to the left
            reminded me that such was the common formula for finding the central courtyard of certain labyrinths. I know
            something about labyrinths. Not for nothing am I the greatgrandson of Ts'ui Pen. He was Governor of Yunnan
            and gave up temporal power to write a novel with more characters than there are in the Hung Lou Meng, and to
            create a maze in which all men would lose themselves. He spent thirteen years on these oddly assorted tasks
            before he was assassinated by a stranger. His novel had no sense to it and nobody ever found his
            labyrinth.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">Under the trees of England I meditated on this lost and perhaps mythical labyrinth. I
            imagined it untouched and perfect on the secret summit of some mountain; I imagined it drowned under rice
            paddies or beneath the sea; I imagined it infinite, made not only of eight-sided pavilions and of twisting
            paths but also of rivers, provinces and kingdoms ... I thought of a maze of mazes, of a sinuous, ever
            growing maze which would take in both past and future and would somehow involve the stars.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">Lost in these imaginary illusions I forgot my destiny - that of the hunted. For an
            undetermined period of time I felt myself cut off from the world, an abstract spectator. The hazy and
            murmuring countryside, the moon, the decline of the evening, stirred within me. Going down the gently
            sloping road I could not feel fatigue. The evening was at once intimate and infinite.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">The road kept descending and branching off, through meadows misty in the twilight. A
            high-pitched and almost syllabic music kept coming and going, moving with the breeze, blurred by the leaves
            and by distance. I thought that a man might be an enemy of other men, of the differing moments of other men,
            but never an enemy of a country: not of fireflies, words, gardens, streams, or the West wind. </a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">Meditating thus I arrived at a high, rusty iron gate. Through the railings I could see
            an avenue bordered with poplar trees and also a kind of summer house or pavilion. Two things dawned on me at
            once, the first trivial and the second almost incredible: the music came from the pavilion and that music
            was Chinese. That was why I had accepted it fully, without paying it any attention. I do not remember
            whether there was a bell, a push-button, or whether I attracted attention by clapping my hands. The
            stuttering sparks of the music kept on.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">But from the end of the avenue, from the main house, a lantern approached; a lantern
            which alternately, from moment to moment, was crisscrossed or put out by the trunks of the trees; a paper
            lantern shaped like a drum and colored like the moon. A tall man carried it. I could not see his face for
            the light blinded me.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">He opened the gate and spoke slowly in my language. "I see that the worthy Hsi P'eng
            has troubled himself to see to relieving my solitude. No doubt you want to see the garden?"Recognizing the
            name of one of our consuls, I replied, somewhat taken aback. "The garden?" "The garden of forking paths."
            Something stirred in my memory and I said, with incomprehensible assurance: "The garden of my ancestor,
            Ts'ui Pen." "Your ancestor? Your illustrious ancestor? Come in."</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">The damp path zigzagged like those of my childhood. When we reached the house, we went
            into a library filled with books from both East and West. I recognized some large volumes bound in yellow
            silk-manuscripts of the Lost Encyclopedia which was edited by the Third Emperor of the Luminous Dynasty.
            They had never been printed. A phonograph record was spinning near a bronze phoenix. I remember also a
            rose-glazed jar and yet another, older by many centuries, of that blue color which our potters copied from
            the Persians . . . </a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">Stephen Albert was watching me with a smile on his face. He was, as I have said,
            remarkably tall. His face was deeply lined and he had gray eyes and a gray beard. There was about him
            something of the priest, and something of the sailor. Later, he told me he had been a missionary in Tientsin
            before he "had aspired to become a Sinologist." </a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">We sat down, I upon a large, low divan, he with his back to the window and to a large
            circular clock. I calculated that my pursuer, Richard Madden, could not arrive in less than an hour. My
            irrevocable decision could wait.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">"A strange destiny," said Stephen Albert, "that of Ts'ui Pen - Governor of his native
            province, learned in astronomy, in astrology and tireless in the interpretation of the canonical books, a
            chess player, a famous poet and a calligrapher. Yet he abandoned all to make a book and a labyrinth. He gave
            up all the pleasures of oppression, justice, of a well-stocked bed, of banquets, and even of erudition, and
            shut himself up in the Pavilion of the Limpid Sun for thirteen years. At his death, his heirs found only a
            mess of manuscripts. The family, as you doubtless know, wished to consign them to the fire, but the executor
            of the estate - a Taoist or a Buddhist monk - insisted on their publication."</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">"Those of the blood of Ts'ui Pen," I replied, "still curse the memory of that monk.
            Such a publication was madness. The book is a shapeless mass of contradictory rough drafts. I examined it
            once upon a time: the hero dies in the third chapter, while in the fourth he is alive. As for that other
            enterprise of Ts'ui Pen ... his Labyrinth . . ." "Here is the Labyrinth," Albert said, pointing to a tall,
            laquered writing cabinet. "An ivory labyrinth?" I exclaimed. "A tiny labyrinth indeed . . . !" </a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">"A symbolic labyrinth," he corrected me. "An invisible labyrinth of time. I, a
            barbarous Englishman, have been given the key to this transparent mystery. After more than a hundred years
            most of the details are irrecoverable, lost beyond all recall, but it isn't hard to image what must have
            happened. At one time, Ts'ui Pen must have said; 'I am going into seclusion to write a book,' and at
            another, 'I am retiring to construct a maze.' Everyone assumed these were separate activities. No one
            realized that the book and the labyrinth were one and the same. The Pavilion of the Limpid Sun was set in
            the middle of an intricate garden. This may have suggested the idea of a physical maze.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">"Ts'ui Pen died. In all the vast lands which once belonged to your family, no one could
            find the labyrinth. The novel's confusion suggested that it was the labyrinth. Two circumstances showed me
            the direct solution to the problem. First, the curious legend that Ts'ui Pen had proposed to create an
            infinite maze, second, a fragment of a letter which I discovered."</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">Albert rose. For a few moments he turned his back to me. He opened the top drawer in
            the high black and gilded writing cabinet. He returned holding in his hand a piece of paper which had once
            been crimson but which had faded with the passage of time: it was rose colored, tenuous, quadrangular. Ts'ui
            Pen's calligraphy was justly famous. Eagerly, but without understanding, I read the words which a man of my
            own blood had written with a small brush: "I leave to various future times, but not to all, my garden of
            forking paths."</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">I handed back the sheet of paper in silence. Albert went on: "Before I discovered this
            letter, I kept asking myself how a book could be infinite. I could not imagine any other than a cyclic
            volume, circular. A volume whose last page would be the same as the first and so have the possibility of
            continuing indefinitely. I recalled, too, the night in the middle of The Thousand and One Nights when Queen
            Scheherezade, through a magical mistake on the part of her copyist, started to tell the story of The
            Thousand and One Nights, with the risk of again arriving at the night upon which she will relate it, and
            thus on to infinity. I also imagined a Platonic hereditary work, passed on from father to son, to which each
            individual would add a new chapter or correct, with pious care, the work of his elders.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">"These conjectures gave me amusement, but none seemed to have the remotest application
            to the contradictory chapters of Ts'ui Pen. At this point, I was sent from Oxford the manuscript you have
            just seen.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">"Naturally, my attention was caught by the sentence, 'I leave to various future times,
            but not to all, my garden of forking paths: I had no sooner read this, than I understood. The Garden of
            Forking Paths was the chaotic novel itself. The phrase 'to various future times, but not to all' suggested
            the image of bifurcating in time, not in space. Rereading the whole work confirmed this theory. In all
            fiction, when a man is faced with alternatives he chooses one at the expense of the others. In the almost
            unfathomable Ts'ui Pen, he chooses - simultaneously - all of them. He thus creates various futures, various
            times which start others that will in their turn branch out and bifurcate in other times. This is the cause
            of the contradictions in the novel.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">"Fang, let us say, has a secret. A stranger knocks at his door. Fang makes up his mind
            to kill him. Naturally there are various possible outcomes. Fang can kill the intruder, the intruder can
            kill Fang, both can be saved, both can die and so on and so on. In Ts'ui Pen's work, all the possible
            solutions occur, each one being the point of departure for other bifurcations. Sometimes the pathways of
            this labyrinth converge. For example, you come to this house; but in other possible pasts you are my enemy;
            in others my friend.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">"If you will put up with my atrocious pronunciation, I would like to read you a few
            pages of your ancestor's work." His countenance, in the bright circle of lamplight, was certainly that of an
            ancient, but it shone with something unyielding, even immortal.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">With slow precision, he read two versions of the same epic chapter. In the first, an
            army marches into battle over a desolate mountain pass. The bleak and somber aspect of the rocky landscape
            made the soldiers feel that life itself was of little value, and so they won the battle easily. In the
            second, the same army passes through a palace where a banquet is in progress. The splendor of the feast
            remained a memory throughout the glorious battle, and so victory followed.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">With proper veneration I listened to these old tales, although perhaps with less
            admiration for them in themselves than for the fact that they had been thought out by one of my own blood,
            and that a man of a distant empire had given them back to me, in the last stage of a desperate adventure, on
            a Western island. I remember the final words, repeated at the end of each version like a secret command:
            "Thus the heroes fought, with tranquil heart and bloody sword. They were resigned to killing and to
            dying."</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">At that moment I felt within me and around me something invisible and intangible
            pullulating. It was not the pullulation of two divergent, parallel, and finally converging armies, but an
            agitation more inaccessible, more intimate, prefigured by them in some way. Stephen Albert continued:</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">"I do not think that your illustrious ancestor toyed idly with variations. I do not
            find it believable that he would waste thirteen years laboring over a never ending experiment in rhetoric.
            In your country the novel is an inferior genre; in Ts'ui Pen's period, it was a despised one. Ts'ui Pen was
            a fine novelist but he was also a man of letters who, doubtless, considered himself more than a mere
            novelist. The testimony of his contemporaries attests to this, and certainly the known facts of his life
            confirm his leanings toward the metaphysical and the mystical.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">Philosophical conjectures take up the greater part of his novel. I know that of all
            problems, none disquieted him more, and none concerned him more than the profound one of time. Now then,
            this is the only problem that does not figure in the pages of The Garden. He does not even use the word
            which means time. How can these voluntary omissions be explained?" I proposed various solutions, all of them
            inadequate. We discussed them.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">Finally Stephen Albert said: "In a guessing game to which the answer is chess, which
            word is the only one prohibited?" I thought for a moment and then replied: "The word is chess."</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">"Precisely," said Albert. "The Garden of Forking Paths is an enormous guessing game, or
            parable, in which the subject is time. The rules of the game forbid the use of the word itself. To eliminate
            a word completely, to refer to it by means of inept phrases and obvious paraphrases, is perhaps the best way
            of drawing attention to it. This, then, is the tortuous method of approach preferred by the oblique Ts'ui
            Pen in every meandering of his interminable novel. I have gone over hundreds of manuscripts, I have
            corrected errors introduced by careless copyists, I have worked out the plan from this chaos, I have
            restored, or believe I have restored, the original. I have translated the whole work. I can state
            categorically that not once has the word time been used in the whole book.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">"The explanation is obvious. The Garden of Forking Paths is a picture, incomplete yet
            not false, of the universe such as Ts'ui Pen conceived it to be. Differing from Newton and Schopenhauer,
            your ancestor did not think of time as absolute and uniform. He believed in an infinite series of times, in
            a dizzily growing, ever spreading network of diverging, converging and parallel times. This web of time -
            the strands of which approach one another, bifurcate, intersect or ignore each other through the centuries -
            embraces every possibility. We do not exist in most of them. In some you exist and not I, while in others I
            do, and you do not, and in yet others both of us exist. In this one, in which chance has favored me, you
            have come to my gate. In another, you, crossing the garden, have found me dead. In yet another, I say these
            very same words, but am an error, a phantom."</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">"In all of them," I enunciated, with a tremor in my voice. "I deeply appreciate and am
            grateful to you for the restoration of Ts'ui Pen's garden." "Not in all," he murmured with a smile. "Time is
            forever dividing itself toward innumerable futures and in one of them I am your enemy."</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">Once again I sensed the pullulation of which I have already spoken. It seemed to me
            that the dew-damp garden surrounding the house was infinitely saturated with invisible people. All were
            Albert and myself, secretive, busy and multiform in other dimensions of time. I lifted my eyes and the short
            nightmare disappeared. In the black and yellow garden there was only a single man, but this man was as
            strong as a statue and this man was walking up the path and he was Captain Richard Madden.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">"The future exists now," I replied. "But I am your friend. Can I take another look at
            the letter?" Albert rose from his seat. He stood up tall as he opened the top drawer of the high writing
            cabinet. For a moment his back was again turned to me. I had the revolver ready. I fired with the utmost
            care: Albert fell without a murmur, at once. I swear that his death was instantaneous, as if he had been
            struck by lightning.</a>
        <a href="forking-paths/">What remains is unreal and unimportant. Madden broke in and arrested me. I have been
            condemned to hang. Abominably, I have yet triumphed! The secret name of the city to be attacked got through
            to Berlin. Yesterday it was bombed. I read the news in the same English newspapers which were trying to
            solve the riddle of the murder of the learned Sinologist Stephen Albert by the unknown Yu Tsun. The Chief,
            however, had already solved this mystery. He knew that my problem was to shout, with my feeble voice, above
            the tumult of war, the name of the city called Albert, and that I had no other course open to me than to
            kill someone of that name. He does not know, for no one can, of my infinite penitence and sickness of the
            heart.</a>
